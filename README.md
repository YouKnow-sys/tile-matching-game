A simple tile matching game created using [Vizia](https://github.com/vizia/vizia.git).

I created this game to get to know vizia better and also create a more complex example for it.

You can find the executable for trying it out in **release** section.

## Optional features
- `serde`: if enabled game will save settings in `pwd` before closing the game, and load them whenever we start the game later.

## Todo
- [ ] add support for switching between dark and light theme
- [ ] add a way to save and show highscores
- [ ] maybe add sound effects
